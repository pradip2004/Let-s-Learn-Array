# Array in C++

In this article you will learn all the concept of Array in C++.
Not only concept also I give you some good level of questions along with solution for your better level of understanding.
In this article We will discuss about declaration, initialization, accessing elements, insertion and deletion operations on array. After that one more article will be upload which contains some advance information about Array.

So let's Deep dive into the sea of the programming and find some Pearl for your skills.

## ðŸ“’Introduction

Frist we need to know what is array, okay so lets take a practical example - 
We all have cupboard in our house, right!!
If I say you that your cupboard is an array then what is your rection. You may laugh on me, okey no problem I,ll explain how..

lets see what is the defination of the array


> <b> <em> <span style="color:#219ebc;"> An array is a collection of data that hold values of same type. It consists of multiple variables stored at contiguous memory locations. </span> </em> </b>



If we breakdown the definition into some points lets see what exactly the defination want to say


> - <span style="color:#dda15e"> Array nothing but a box/container which store data  (same type of data) 
> - <span style="color:#dda15e"> It's store multiple data at <b><em>contiguous memory location</b></em> </span>

Now lets compare with example 
<br>

> - <span style="color:#dda15e"> in this cupboard we store our cloths (`data`) <br> we can store only colths in our cupboard we don't store our kitchen items so in cupboard we store `same type of data`
>- <span style="color:#dda15e"> we store cloth in separate selfs (`one memory location`) and all selfs are conneted next to each other (`contiguous  memory location`).

<b><span style="color:#81b29a;">so we can say cupboard is also an Array. I thing this example is clear to you to understand Array</span></b>

ðŸŒŸ**Contiguous Memory Location:**  As explain above contiguous memory location means `series of adjacent memory addresses in a computer's memory where data is stored sequentially.`
